1) React documentation notes:
- JSX is optional
- with JSX you pass a function as the event handler, not a string
- use preventDefault vs. false
- React apps have a single root DOM node


1b) Reading documentation more effectively (mentor discussion)
- Especially good for staring with a "new" language/library
- code you see in docs used as kind of a "style guide"
-

Notes:
- Look up pure functions
